"Design a modern, responsive frontend for AprameyaKLU.com, a club dedicated to autonomous vehicle technology and self-driving car development. The website should have a clean, futuristic aesthetic with a color scheme of blues, whites, and subtle grays, reflecting cutting-edge tech. Focus solely on the frontend—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—with no backend integration for now. Include the following pages with specific content and layouts as described below, ensuring easy navigation via a consistent top navigation bar across all pages. Use placeholder text and images where specified, and make it mobile-friendly and SEO-optimized.
